Ok  so lets start, who am I ? I am  Alejandro solano

I have a computer engineer degree and a salesforce admin certification

When I finished my computer degree 
I started to work in financial companies for more less 6 years in IT duties
about my QA experience
My first project was with PROS 
doing UX testing in an app called PPSS 
my duties were identify issues and risks, 
test case creation, execution and test case maintain 

After that I worked in a new project for same client, 
called Quote2Win using salesforce platform so why salesforce, 
at the beginning of the project we did a POC about some platform as a service providers 
like cast iron, dynamics and salesforce 
and the winner was salesforce 
due its customer relationship management 
and application development were and are more solid than the other providers, 
the project was about pricing using salesforce, 

for a while the test task there was over UI, data security and consistence 
once we got a first client, the test task changed, 
it was necessary to do other kind of test like load, and stress, 
for that we used jmeter witch allowed to simulate many users logged at same time doing may operations

once the project started growing in its complexity, 
the team decided to start thinking in automation, 
so we started learning selenium, 
and the first automation project was with selenium IDE 
which is a tool to record user actions, 
save and play them in order to validate some assertions, 
in that time the automation task was not complex but 
due the Q2W app required more test automation, 
the QA team decided to use selenium web driver, 
java as programming language and jenkins  server for continuos integration 
in order to have night verified builds and have reported bugs at morning

due my experience in software as a service platform, 
I was moved to a little project for PROS too, 
in that time I developed automation test using selenium web driver, 
phyton as programing language plus behave as BDD framework 
and salesforce as software as a service provided, 

The client requested to do the same automation task for dynamics 
which is a Microsoft software as a service platform 
but it was not ended due the client finished the project suddenly

after that I was moved to an IBM project called RCM for softlayer 
in order to start automation for a web tool that they used as  platform as a service, 
and due my automation experience, 
I developed there automation test using selenium web driver, 
python as programming language, 
behave and gerkins BDD tools due we needed to share tests with non developers 
and page object pattern which is an object repository 
for storing all web elements and actions over those web elements

after that I worked in a  new project for a mobile app for genghis company called speakeasy, 
there, I learned mobile testing on android and iOS devices 
once we had a solid mobile app, QA team decided to migrate our manual test to automation, 
for that we did some research about the best automation tool, 
Appium was selected, and we started automation tasks using java as programming language 
Unfortunately the automation project didnâ€™t finished.
